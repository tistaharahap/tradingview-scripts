# TradingView Scripts

This repo contains all of the scripts I wrote for TradingView.

## Oscillators

The scripts here are oscillators usually being used to spot overbought or oversold conditions which is a load of crap. Using these as divergences spotter bodes well.

### Money Flow Index

Money Flow Index indicator script taken from [https://www.tradingview.com/script/g58H59ub-Money-Flow-Index-Beasley-Savage/](https://www.tradingview.com/script/g58H59ub-Money-Flow-Index-Beasley-Savage/).

## Divergences

The scripts here will plot bullish and bearish divergences both hiddens or regulars.

### CCI Divergences

Modified TradingView's built-in `Divergences Indicator` script to use [Commodity Channel Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commoditychannelindex.asp) indicator as the oscillator.

### MFI Divergences

Modified TradingView's built in `Divergences Indicator` script to use [Money Flow Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mfi.asp) indicator as the oscillator.
