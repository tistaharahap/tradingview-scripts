# TradingView Scripts

This repo contains all of the scripts I wrote for TradingView.

## Oscillators

The scripts here are oscillators usually being used to spot overbought or oversold conditions which is a load of crap. Using these as divergences spotter bodes well.

## Histograms

The scripts are are histograms to spot weaknesses we can exploit. Also good for divergences if applicable.

### CM Williams Fix Vix Red Green

## Divergences

The scripts here will plot bullish and bearish divergences both hiddens or regulars.
